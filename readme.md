## Introduction

Network Routing Simulator is a tool for simulating and visualizing network routing algorithms. It’s designed for students and professionals interested in understanding the functioning of routing protocols at a deeper level. The simulator includes popular algorithms like Distance Vector and Link State, each represented with step-by-step visuals to illustrate their operation.

## Features

- **Algorithm Visualizations**: See routing tables update dynamically as each algorithm progresses.
- **Interactive Elements**: Customize network topology by adding or removing nodes and links.
- **Educational Utility**: An excellent tool for those studying computer networks, as it provides insights into how routing algorithms function.

## Routing Algorithms Simulated

1. **Distance Vector Routing (DVR)** - Uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest path by exchanging information with neighbors.
2. **Link State Routing (LSR)** - Utilizes Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest path calculation, broadcasting information across the network.
3. **Path Selection and Packet Routing** - Visualizes packet movement from source to destination, showing route taken based on the selected routing algorithm.

## Installation
1. Open the `Network_Routing_Simulator.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Configure the network by defining nodes and edges to represent routers and connections.
3. Run the cells to simulate routing algorithms on the defined network topology.
4. Observe the routing tables and packet flow visualizations.
